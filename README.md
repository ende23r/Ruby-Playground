# Ruby on Rails Tutorial: "hello, world!"

This is the first application for the
[*Ruby on Rails Tutorial*](http://www.railstutorial.org/)
by [Michael Hartl](http://www.michaelhartl.com/).

'git commit -a'

wraps up all changes to existing files,
but we need
'git add -A'

if we ever add a new file.
